Paperclip is now compatible with aws-sdk-s3.

If you are using S3 storage, aws-sdk-s3 requires you to make a few small
changes:

* You must set the `s3_region`
* If you are explicitly setting permissions anywhere, such as in an initializer,
  note that the format of the permissions changed from using an underscore to
  using a hyphen. For example, `:public_read` needs to be changed to
  `public-read`.
